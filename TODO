TODO - BUGS - DONE

GENERAL CRITERIA TO SATISFY

- Follow general pattern of other applications
  Consistent buttons, colors, actions

- Items must have siutable affordance
  User must clearly see whta he can do with the item

- Use USER-CENTRIC features (and language)
  avoid system-centric features.

- FEEDBACKS to the user: each action must produce something visible.

- MESSAGES must be concise, and to the point
  Use a consistent jargon, but allow users more freedom of terms

- USER INPUTS:
  - Make clear how user inputs are used
  - Provide DEFAULTS (when possible)
    Every dialog must have defaults
    Use defaults to teach users
  - User errors PREVENTION
    Avoid textboxes if possible (choice, combobox, radiobutton, ...)
  - Let user back up from errors

- Use ERROR MESSAGES to teach usage: HINTS what to do

- Do not OVERLOAD interaction: do not put two metaphors in one dialog

- Avoid FRAGMENTATION: too many dialogs to say one thing

- Simplicity: regularity (placement, font, color, size)
              differences are for "important" things
              contrast: color, hue, texture, form, position orientation, size
              white space gestalt: proximity, similarity, continuity, closure
                                   area, simmetry
              alignment
              color

COMPILE DEFINES

USER_HORIZONTAL_CROSS_SECTION
let the user decide when a cross section is vertical or horizontal
otherwise use threshold in config file

TODO


LRUD
test LRUD in therion/compass exports
write LRUD in the export (survex)
use LRUD in the plot

plot grids
set spacing in options/config
PlotStatus has field grid_spacing

feedbacks whether shots/points have comments
line color or thickness ?

stations on cross-sections

In the drawing plot window there is no "select-and-move" a point
(drag-n-drop).

20091231
on exit save the current config setting in user home .qtopo.rc

Give depth to the 3D view
20091223 made an attempt using line thickness.
         would like to use gradients, but not sure qt v.3 has them

Fast Background warping methods

Fix Download action for QTcalib as in QTshot
20091227 done but must check that i made no mistake

Add history of most recently opened files ...
need to write in the user home directory

----------------------------------------------------
Things that might be OK

20100106
scale bar on the plan and extended plots
kind of crude, but ok.

Background images:
- not persistent between close/open of the Plot.
- not exported in th2 files
- at most only one image at a time (previous ones are dropped)


20091231 extend flag in th export:
for the moment fixed exporting first the centerline,
then the splay shots, and computing the extend for each splay shot
with an heuristics

20091227 Help functionality
with extern helper browser
might be done with QHelper class, but Qt3 does not have it
