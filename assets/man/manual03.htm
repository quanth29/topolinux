<h3>[3] AUXILIARY APPS</h3><br><p>

When working with TopoDroid, you might find useful some complementary and auxiliary apps:
<ulist>
<li><i>Cave3D</i> is a 3D viewer for Therion files, and is used by TopoDroid for the 3D display</li>
<li><i>Proj4</i> is a (very simple) coordinate converter app, used by TopoDroid to convert long-lat values to other coordinate systems</li>
<li><i>GPSAveraging</i> is a location app. TopoDroid can use it to determine point locations, but it can also do that without this app</li>
<li>an app to take pictures (usually there is a <i>Camera</i> app)</li>
<li><i>SQLiteViewer</i> (or any other SQLite maanger app) can be helpful to inspect the TopoDroid database</li>
<li>a File Manager (eg. <i>AndExplorer</i>) is definitely useful to look at the files (and to make backup copies)</li>
<li>a Text Editor (eg. <i>Jota</i> Text Editor), can be used to see the text files</li>
</ulist><br><p>

In addition, depending how you process your surveys, you may want to install
<ulist>
<li>a image viewer/editor (usually there is a preinstalled image viewer, <i>Gallery</i>)</li>
<li>a DXF viewer/editor</li>
<li>a spreadsheet viewer/editor</li>
<li>a ZIP archiver</li>
</ulist><br><p>

Finally a <i>wakeup-touch</i> app turns out to be very convenient during the survey session in the cave. In order to save battery you may want to set the display sleep timeout very short (eg, half a minute). With a wakeup-touch app you do not have to press the power button to wake up your android, but just need to touch the proximity sensor. I use to keep my device in a protective box opening only the cover lid. The power button on the side is therefore not accessible when the device is in the box, and the wakeup-touch app is really handy.
