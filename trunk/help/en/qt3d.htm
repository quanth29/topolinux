<h3>QTopo - 3D viewer</h3>

The 3D viewer displays the centeline and splay shots
in 3D. The centerline shots are red, the splay shots are black.
Cneterline shots are the thicker the closer they are to the
viewpoint.
<p>

The point of view can be changed with the 
<i>rotation</i> buttons. The inclination goes from -90
to +90 degrees, while the azimuth goes al the way around
the 360 degrees.
