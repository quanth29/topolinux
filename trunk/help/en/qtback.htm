<h3>QTopo - Background sketch</h3>

You can add a background sketch to the drawing window,
to help you make the drawing.
To do this click on the <i>Sketch</i> 
<a href="qtplotbuttons.htm">command button</a> of the
drawing window. This ask you for a PNG image file, hopefully
the image of a cave sketch,
and displays it in the <i>background sketch</i> window.

You have to select some station points in the image so that
QTopo knows how to insert it as background. Two stations are
the minimum requirement.
To select a station click on it on the image: it will be
maked by a cross and a dialog will ask you the station name.
Type it in and click the "OK" button: now the station name
appears near the cross.

When you are done click the "OK" command button.
The image will be imported as background sketch in the
drawing window. Be aware that the background sketch is
not saved with the drawing. Therefore you lose it
when you close the drawing window.
