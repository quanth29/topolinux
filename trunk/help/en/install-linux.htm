<h3>TopoLinux - Linux Installation</h3>
<p>
<br>
<p>

<b>Sources</b>
<p>
The safest way to install QTopo on Linux is to compile it from the
sources. Download and untar the source tgz:
<pre>
	tar -xzf qtopo-XXX.tgz
</pre>
This will create a directory TopoLinux, with the following subdirectories:
<pre>
   bin .......... executable files
   basic-02 ..... TopoLinux utilities
   calib-02 ..... TopoLinux calibration utilities
   distox ....... DistoX connection and communication
   docs ......... documentation
   help ......... help pages
   i18n ......... internationalization data files
   icons ........ run-time icons
   pixmaps ...... compile-time pixmaps
   QTcalib-02 ... QTopoCalib classes
   QTshot-02 .... QTopoShot classes
   utils ........ utility classes
   tmp .......... data
</pre>
The source files are in <tt>distox</tt>, <tt>utils</tt>, <tt>basic-02</tt>,
<tt>calib-02</tt>, <tt>QTshot-02</tt> and <tt>QTcalib-02</tt>.
Unless you must work without a window environment,
it is not necessary to compile the programs in <tt>basic-02</tt> and <tt>calib-02</tt>.
There are also a few files, the most important of which is
the run-time configuration file <tt>qtopo.rc</tt>.
<p>

There is no "configure" and you must compile everything by hand.
You need the C++ and Qt development environment (g++, etc., and Qt),
and you must compile the sources in four directories:
<ol>
<li><tt>cd distox; make</tt></li>
<li><tt>cd utils; make</tt></li>
<li><tt>cd QTshot; qmake; make</tt></li>
<li><tt>cd QTcalib; qmake; make</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>

At this point you have two executables <tt>QTshot-02/qtshot</tt> and
<tt>QTcalib-02/qtcalib</tt>.
Run them from the <tt>TopoLinux</tt> root directory, as they look for
the run-time resources from there.
<p>
<br>
<p>

<b>Precompiled</b>
<p>
The precompiled download archive contains the subdirectories 
<pre>
	bin ......... executables
	docs ........ documentation
	i18n ........ internationalization data
	icons ....... run-time icons
	help ........ help pages
	tmp ......... data
</pre>
<p>

Furthermore, there is the run-time configuration file <tt>qtopo.rc</tt>.
<p>

You need to have the Qt run-time (libraries) installed.
To execute a program, invoke it from the <tt>TopoLinux</tt> root directory.
For example
<pre>
	./bin/qtshot
</pre>
