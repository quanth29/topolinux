<h3>QTopo - Drawing</h3>
<p>
<br>
<p>

In the QTopo drawing window you can draw scraps and save
them in therion format "th2".
<p>

To effectively draw your scraps stick to the following workflow:
<ol>
<li>check in the shot table that the shot stations are correct.
You can use the 3D window and the plan and extended section windows
to visualize the centerline with the stations. The plot do not
update at the changes to the shot table; to refresh them switch on and off
the grid.</li>
<li>check with the extended plot window that the shots are extended correctly.
These two steps can be done together.</li>
<li>draw the plan and the extended section scrap. It is useful (but not 
necessary) to follow these steps:
  <ul>
  <li>select the station points;</li>
  <li>draw the wall lines;</li>
  <li>draw the other lines;</li>
  <li>draw the points.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>save the scraps</li>
</ol>
