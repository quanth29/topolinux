<h3>QTopo - Lines</h3>
<p>
<br>
<p>

You can add lines to the plot in the QTopo drawing windows.
Lines are drawn as sequences of points: they are just like centerlines
and you mark all the stations in sequence to draw them.
<P>

Only a few Therion line types are supported and there is only a limited
support for their options.
<ul>
<li><i>wall</i>. This is displayed as solid blue line.</li>
<li><i>border</i>. Displayed as solid violet line.</li>
<li><i>pit</i>. Displayed as solid violet line with ticks pointing 
"into the cave empty space", as in Therion.</li>
<li><i>chimney</i>. Displayed as dashed violet line with ticks pointing 
"into the cave empty space", as in Therion.</li>
<li><i>arrow</i>. Displayed as solid black lines with small arrow-heads
at the end it points to.</li>
<li><i>rock-border</i>. Displayed as solid gray line.</li>
<li><i>user</i>. Displayed as solid green line.</li>
</ul>
<p>

Furthermore centerline shot are red.<br>
Splay shots are black. To display them
use the <i>Splay toggle</i> button.<br>

In <i>Line insert</i> mode the <i>Mode</i> button shows a pencil,
and the cursor is a pencil. It is vertical
before you start drawing, and turns slanted while you draw the
line.
Lines are drawn as consecutive segments: you click on the
points in sequence. 
To finish the line click a second time on the last point. 
You finish a line also be clicking on its first point; this way
you get a closed line.
A line is automatically finished if you switch mode, or change line type.
