<h3>[13] CROSS SECTION</h3>

Cross-sections are kind of special. To tell TopoDroid that you want to draw a cross-section you must draw a "section" line, either in the plan view or in the extended elevation view. The section line defines the position of the cross-section and its orientation. The direction of view of the section follows therion convention: from the right side of the section line to the left side. As a reminder the section line has a tick pointing in the direction of view of the cross-section.<br><p>

You can choose between a photo cross-section (taken with the camera), or a sketch cross-section. In the first case just take a photo that will remind you the shape of the gallery when you will be drafting the cave map. Make sure to have a fellow caver in the picture who will serve as size reference.<br><p>

In the second case you sketch the cross section on a canvas with the usual drawing tools of TopoDroid. As a reference TopoDroid displays the leg shot traversed by the cross section and the splay shots at its endpoints. The splay shots at the closer station are blue, those at the station far away are grey. All the shots are displayed projected on the plane of the cross section.  Furthermore a reference line 5 m long is added to the section.<br><p>

Once closed cross-section can be opened again and modified by selecting the relative section line in "edit" mode and tapping the <u>Edit</u> button.<br><p>

<h4>Cross-sections orientation</h4>
Cross-section defined in the plan sketch are always vertical. Those defined in the extended profile sketch can be either vertical or horizontal. The program chooses acconding to the inclination of the cutted leg: if this is larger than the H-threshold the cross-section is horizontal, otherwise it is vertical. The value of H-threshold is set through the settings.<br><p>

Let's say the section line crosses the leg 1-2.  The section line is oriented as in Therion. If its orientation agrees with that of the leg, the cross-section is considered as viewed from station 1 towards station 2. Otherwise it's the other way around: viewed from station 2 towards station 1.<br><p>

<b>Vertical cross-sections in the extended profile</b><br>
For vertical cross-sections defined in the extended profile, the azimuth of the cross-section plane is that of the leg (if the directions of the section line agrres with the extend of the leg) or the opposite (if the direction does not agree with the extend).<br><p>

<b>Horizontal cross-sections in the extended profile</b><br>
Horizintal cross-section are sections viewed either from above (if the section line is oriented downward) or from below (if it is oriented upward). In the first case the cross-section is oriented with North upward, and East rightward, as when you look at a map on the table. In the secoind case the section is oriented with North downward and East rightward, as if you were looking from behind at a map drawn on a transparent sheet.<br><p>

<b>Vertical cross-sections in the plan</b><br>
Cross-section in the plan are always vertical. They are oriented according to the direction of the section line, namely the azimuth of the cross-section plane is defined by this direction. Therefore cross-sections defined in the plan may not be orthogonal to the crosed leg, which, depending on the section azimuth, may appear not vertical.<br><p>
