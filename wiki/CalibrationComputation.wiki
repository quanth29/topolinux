#summary Calibration computation

= Calibration computation =


To compute the calibration click on the Compute button. The result of the calibration computation is shown in a dialog box. The most interesting piece of information is the average error. It is in degrees and it gives an estimate of the precision achievable with the calibration. The error (in degrees) for each data is shown in the Error column of the table. To sort the data by decreasing error double click on the header of the column. To go back to the data arranged by the group double click on the header of the Set column.


Next the calibration coefficients are shown. These are displayed also when you read them from the DistoX.
