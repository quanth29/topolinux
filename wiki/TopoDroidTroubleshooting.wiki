=== TopoDroid does not detect DistoX ===

You may try to detect and pair your android with the DistoX
using the "Settings" app. Under the item Wireless and Network,
select Bluetooth and scan for devices.

If this app fails there is no chance that TopoDroid will detect 
the DistoX. After the Settings app can pair to the DistoX, you should
be able to see it with TopoDroid in the list of "Paired devices".
