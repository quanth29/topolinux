=== TopoDroid crashes ===

It can happen !!!

TopoDroid is developed using English locale and
names without spaces. It is possible that another locale, or names
containing spaces break the application. If this is the case, please
send me a detailed description of what you did and what happened, and
i will try to fix the problem. Attach any file that might be useful.

You may also try to reproduce the crash working with English locale
and name composed of only the caharcters of the English alphabeth [a-z and
A-Z] and digits [0-9].


=== TopoDroid does not detect DistoX ===

You may try to detect and pair your android with the DistoX
using the "Settings" app. Under the item Wireless and Network,
select Bluetooth and scan for devices.

If this app fails there is no chance that TopoDroid will detect 
the DistoX. After the Settings app can pair to the DistoX, you should
be able to see it with TopoDroid in the list of "Paired devices".

If the app Settings cannot detect and pair with the DistoX, there is a
problem with your android BlueTooth.


=== TopoDroid does not show the shots ===

Make sure that the "Hide blank shots" submenu of "Survey" is not checked.

You can always inspect the database, with a SQLite app to check whether the
data have been downloaded and are there.
