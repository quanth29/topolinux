= QTopo - Points =


To add points to the plot you switch to Point insert mode and click where you want to put the points. In this mode the cursor is a cross-air, and the Mode button shows a cross.

Only a few Therion point types are supported and there is only a limited support for their options.

    * station. This is somewhat special. You insert a station point by clicking on its name in Select mode. If you click again on the name of a station point you have already added, a point-comment dialog shows up where you can enter a description for the station.
