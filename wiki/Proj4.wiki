= Proj4 =

Proj4 is an app to convert between coordinate reference systems (CRS).
It is based on the proj4 library.

== Coordinate syntax ==

Altitude (Z coordinate) is always in meters.
The X and Y coordinates can be in meters or in degrees
depending on the CRS used. You can use decimal degrees or
degrees,minutes.seconds.

== CRS syntax ==

Proj4 comes with only a few CRS, but
you can add all the CRS that you need.
To do this you must give a nickname to the new CRS
and write its spec in the proj4 syntax.

For example: "+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +no_defs +a=6378388 +rf=297 +towgs84=-104.1,-49.1,-9.9,0.971,-2.917,0.714,-11.68 +to_meter=1

See the proj4 man for details. 

== API ==

The Proj4 app can be called by other apps to compute
a coordinate conversion.

Calling intent extras:
  * "version" Proj4 version (currently "1.1")
  * "cs_from" the nickname of the CRS of the input coordinates (eg. "Long-Lat")
  * "longitude" X coordinate
  * "latitude" Y coordinate
  * "altitude" Z coordinate
  * "cs_to" the nickname of the CRS of the output coordinates [optional]

The output CRS can be changed in the interface before computing the coordinate
conversion.

Return intent extras:
  * "cs_to" the nickname of the CRS of the output coordinates
  * "longitude" X coordinate
  * "latitude" Y coordinate
  * "altitude" Z coordinate
