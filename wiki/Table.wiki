#summary CAlibration data table


= QTopo - Calibration data table =


The calibration data are shown in a table with five columns:

   # the index of the group of the data. A group of calibration data contains all the data taken in the same direction, rotating the DistoX around the laser beam.
   # the "uncalibrated azimuth" of the data, i.e., the azimuth computed without the correction of the calibration.
   # the "uncalibrated clino" of the data, i.e., the inclination computed without the correction of the calibration.
   # the "uncalibrated" roll angle
   # the calibration error. For downloaded data this is zero before computing the calibration.
   # a flag to mark data that must be ignored when the calibration is computed. This is used to leave spurious data, or bad data, out of the computation.

To sort the data by decreasing error double click on the header of the Error column. To go back to the data arranged by the group double click on the header of the Set column.
