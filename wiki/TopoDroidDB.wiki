TopoDroid stores the data in a SQLite database, in the file
_/mnt/sdcard/DB/distox.db_.

The database contains the following tables
  * surveys: list of surveys
  * shots: the surveys shots
  * plots: the surveys plot metadata
  * calibs: list of calibrations
  * gms: the calibrations data

The *surveys* table contains the following fields
  * id: unique identifier of the survey (integer)
  * name: survey nickname (text, one word)
  * date: survey date (yyyy-mm-dd)
  * comment: survey description (text)

The *shots* table contains the following fields
  * surveyId: id of the survey to which the shot belongs (integer)
  * id: unique shot identifier (integer)
  * name: shot name (text). It can have several formats
     - "from-to", centerline shot
     - "from-" or "from", or "-to" splay shot
     - "-" or empty, blank shot
  * distance (double) as tranferred from the DistoX
  * bearing (double) as tranferred from the DistoX
  * clino (double) as tranferred from the DistoX
  * roll (double) as tranferred from the DistoX
  * extend (integer). It can be
     - -1 (left)
     - +1 (right)
     - 0  (vertical)
  * flag (integer): it can be
     - 0 cave (normal) shot
     - 1 surface shot
     - 2 duplicate shot
  * comment (text)

The *plots* table has the following fields
  * surveyId: id of the survey to which the plot belongs (integer)
  * id: unique plot identifier (integer)
  * name (text) plot/scrap name
  * type (integer), scrap type: 
      - 0 (none)
      - 1 (plan)
      - 2 (extended)
      - 3 (x-section) 
  * start (text) plot reference station. The plot data are relative to this station which is the origin of the plot coordinate system.

The *calibs* table has the following fields
  * id (integer) unique identifier
  * name (text) calibration name
  * day (text) calibration date (yyyy-mm-dd)
  * comment (text) additional description

The *gms* table has the following fields
  * calibId (integer) id of the calibration to which this data belongs
  * id (integer) unique identifier
  * gx, gy, gz (integer)
  * mx, my, mz (integer)
  * grp (integer) group. It must be positive; data with group "0" are not used to compute the calibration
  * error (double) error of this data, in the computation of the calibration
