= QTopo - Plot drawing modes =


The drawing window has four operating modes:
    * Select mode. In this mode you can select station points and shots. Only the selected station point are written in the therion scrap. You need at least to select two station points to properly scale and orient the scrap in Therion. To select a station point click on its number; the point will be marked with a cross.
    * Point insert mode. In this mode you can draw therion points other than station.
    * Line insert mode. in this mode you can draw therion lines.
    * Area insert mode, in this mode you can draw therion areas.

You switch mode with the Mode command button. It brings up the mode switch dialog. The three round buttons denote the operating mode. With the two option list you select the point type or the line type. When you select a point type, the dialog switches automatically to Point insert mode. Similarly, if you select a line type it switches to Line insert mode. With the orientation dial you choose the orientation of orientable points (entrance, air-draught, and water-flow).

You can also create new scraps and switch from one scrap to another. The scraps take their projection type from the plot.

You can have as many plots as you need in your survey, and each plot can contain
one or more scraps. Each plot is saved as a single therion th2 file with all the plot scraps. It is also possible to save plots as PNG images.
