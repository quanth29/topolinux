== TopoDroid 2.1 DB =

TopoDroid stores the data in a SQLite database.
The default location of this file 
is in the TopoDroid directory in the "external storage".
The user can override this
by specifying a different place for the directory "TopoDroid".

This page describes TopoDroid v 2.1 database "distox14.sqlite".
