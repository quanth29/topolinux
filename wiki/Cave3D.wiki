Cave3D is an Android app that displays 3D views of cave centerlines.


= Details =

Cave3D displays 3D views of survey data in Therion format.
The opened file is parsed as it were "source-d" in THerion, ie,
recursively going to the files that are "input-ed".

The app displays centerline and splay shots (no LRUD).
The display can be
  * zoomed in/out
  * moved,
  * rotated.

It is possible to display an orthogonal view or a perspective
view. In any casa a horizontal grid is shown underneath the cave.
The red axis is the east, the blue one is the north.
The vertical axis is displayed as a green line.

The cave can be colored by depth or just white.

The display of splay shots can be toggled on/off.
