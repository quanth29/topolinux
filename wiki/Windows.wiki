Next download the Windows precompiled archive, and unzip it. It will create a folder qtshot containing

The sources for the Windows installation are the same as for Linux. See the Linux installation for details. Download the source archive and unzip it.

You need to Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 (v. 9.0) and the Qt development environment (Qt-4.x.x). You need the Qt3 supporti compiled in. Create a new VisualC project with all the C source and header files in the subdirectories

    * distox,
    * utils,
    * QTshot-02.

Open a console window and cd into QTshot-02. Then execute Qt/bin/moc (sustitute the proper path for your installation of Qt) on the files

    * PlotCanvas.h
    * BackgroundImage.h
    * QTshot.h

and include the moc-files in the project. The syntax is "moc -o output_file -D define input_file".

Compile the project, with QT3_SUPPORT.
