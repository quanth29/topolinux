=== I cannot install TopoDroid ===

Make sure that you have selected the following settings on your device:
  * Applications -> Unknown sources
  * Applications -> Development -> USB debugging (if you are using adb)

Next copy the apk to your device, or if you use adb do "adb install TopoDroid.apk".


=== Why TopoDroid saves the survey (data and sketches) in Therion format ? ===

Mainly because Therion is my primary tool to put together the maps of 
cave surveys.


=== Why loops do not close in the plots ? ===

TopoDroid does non implement loop closure.
Working with the DistoX loop usually close rather well and I could do
without loop closure.
As a matter of fact loop closure is not allowed in TopoDroid.
I use similar names for the closure station, eg, "14" and "14a".
This way I can see the misclosures in the scraps.
The when I complete the work with Therion, I close
the loops with "equate" commands.

=== Why are areas only single-line bordered ? ===

Mainly to avoid the complexity of selecting a multi-line border.
A multi-line border is also more brittle due to missing intersections
or multiple intersections. There has been a discussion in the Therion
user list and the single-line solution turned out to be the preferable
way for areas.

Note that TopoDroid closes the line bordering the area. However
xtherion needs that the first point is repeated at the end and may
display a "strange" error dialog.
The repeated point is not required by the therion language, but if it
is missing xtherion complaints.


=== Does TopoDroid save data in other formats (Survex, Compass, VisualTopo, ...) ? ===

Compass, Survex and VisualTopo export are now (2012.11) available.
Data export in other formats may be added, if needed.


=== How can I erase the TopoDroid data ? ===

TopoDroid keeps the survey data and the calibration data
in a SQLite database, namely in the file _/mnt/sdcard/TopoDroid/distox3.db_

You can edit this database with any SQLite manager. I use the 
_aSQLiteManager_ app, which is free. You can also pull the database
to your PC, edit it, and push it back to the android.

Scrap, annotation and exports files are stored in subdirectories
in _/mnt/sdcard/TopoDroid/_. These files are not cleared automatically.
You should clear up these directories now and then.


=== Why I don't see the "welcome message" any more ? === 

The welcome message is shown, at start, only when no
survey is selected. TopoDroid saves the selected survey in the
database.


=== Why can't toggle the DistoX in calibration mode ? ===

First of all make sure that your device is paired with the DistoX.
You can check this in the "Settings" of th e device, under 
"Wireless and Networks | Bluetooth settings".

Next make sure that TopoDroid is talking to the correct DistoX device.
TopoDroid talks to one DistoX at a time: the address of the DistoX is
displayed in the "device window", at the top.

Last TopoDroid should not be connected to the DistoX.
When "connected" TopoDroid downloads data (both survey and calibration data)
continuosly, and stores them in the database.
In this mode it does not send other commands to the DistoX. 
In particular it does not toggle the DistoX mode, nor read/write the
calibration coefficients.

There is no need to keep TopoDroid connected to a DistoX.
You can use TopoDroid downloading data from the DistoX
only when you are ready to work on them, through the "Download" menu.


=== What can i do if TopoDroid crashes ? ===

Get a "logcat" filtered on "DistoX".
If there is something pointing to an invalid value that caused
the crash, send me the logcat.

If the logcat has only system messages, send me an email:
describe what you did and how the app crashed. I can build a
version of the app with debug info enabled in the section that
caused the problem.
The debug info is usually disabled, to limit the log.  



=== Why is TopoDroid not on the Google Play (market) ? ===

The market is a place where developpers sell or give their work to users.
One pays to put apps on the market, expecting to get something
in return for that.
So far it seems that TopoDroid will not have enough buyers to pay 
for it to be on the market.


=== How can I help TopoDroid ? ===

There are several ways you can help TopoDroid:
  * sending an email with your comments. Telling me what you think of it, even if you do not use it. This will surely help me to improve the program.
  * installing to try it out, and letting me know what you dislike (bad features) and what you would like (missing features).
  * you may [http://marcocorvi.altervista.org/marco/donate0.htm donate] money. This is the easiest way to tell me that you are interested in it and want it to continue. All the funding will go in buying new hardware to test TopoDroid.
  * writing some documentaton. This requires more time on your side but it also means that you are more involved in it.
  * translating documentation in other languages.
  * internationalizing TopoDroid, ie, translating the strings in other languages. So far (2012-11) only english and spanish are provided.
  * enrolling to the user mail-list and writing questions and comments.
  * developing the software. Definitely this is a major involvement, and requires a great deal of of time.

Please contact me if you want to help with documentation that may go on this website, or with a translation, or with program development.


=== How can I be assured that TopoDroid will continue ? ===

If I get enough feedbacks, one way or another, I will feel 
sort of obliged to do a better effort to keep TopoDroid going,
because of the people that rely on it.

If other developpers get involved, that will be an even stronger
basis for the project, because it will not rely on me.
