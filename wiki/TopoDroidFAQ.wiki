TopoDroid FAQ

= TopoDroid FAQ =

== Why TopoDroid saves the survey (data and sketches) in Therion format ? ==

Mainly because I use Therion to put together my cave survey.


== How can I erase the TopoDroid data ? ==

TopoDroid keeps the survey data and the calibration data
in a SQLite database, namely in the file _/mnt/sdcard/DB/distox.db_

You can edit this database with any SQLite manager. I use the 
_aSQLiteManager_ app, which is free. You can also pull the database
to your PC, edit it, and push it back to the android.


== Why I don't see the "welcome message" any more ? == 

The welcome message is shown, at start, only when no
survey is selected. TopoDroid saves the selected survey in the
"instance" file _/mnt/sdcard/DB/distox.instance_

If you remov ethis file you get the "welcome message" again
(until you select a survey).


== Why is TopoDroid not on the market ? ==

The market is a place where a developper sells its work to users.
One pays to put apps on the market, expecting to get something
in return for that.
So far it seems that TopoDroid will have enough buyers to pay 
for its stay on the market.


== How can I help TopoDroid ? ==

There are several ways you can help TopoDroid:
  * sending an email with your comments, even if you do use it. 
  * you may donate money. This is the easiest way to tell me that you are interested in it and want it to continue.
  * writing some documentaton. This requires more time on your side but it also means that yo uare more involved in it.
  * developing the software. Definitely this is a major involvement, and requires a lot of time.


== How can I be assured that TopoDroid will continue ? ==

If I get enough feedbacks, one way or another, I will feel 
sort of obliged to do a better effort to keep TopoDroid going,
because of the people that rely on it.

If other developpers get involved, that will be an even stronger
basis for the project.
