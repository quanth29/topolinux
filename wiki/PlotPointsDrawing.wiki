= QTopo - Plot points drawing =


To add points to the plot you switch to Point insert mode and click where you want to put the points. In this mode the cursor is a cross-air, and the Mode button shows a cross.

Only a few Therion point types are supported and there is only a limited support for their options.

    * _station_. This is somewhat special. You insert a station point by clicking on its name in Select mode. If you click again on the name of a station point you have already added, a point-comment dialog shows up where you can enter a description for the station.
    * _air-draught_. Displayed as a light-blue arrow. It has an orientation.
    * _blocks_. Displayed as a gray square.
    * _continuation_. Displayed as a question mark '?'. When you add a continuation point a dialog box opens up for the optional text of the point. Type it in and press the "Enter" key.
    * _debris_. Displayed as a pair of gray triangles.
    * _sand_. Displayed as a pair of gray rectangles.
    * _entrance_. Displayed as a big black triangle. It has an orientation.
