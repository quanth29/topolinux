The InGrigna app is an Android app to browse the Speleological database
of InGrigna.


== The database ==

The Speleological database of InGrigna contains data of
  * the caves of the Grigne area: survey data, maps, photoes, description (almost 1000)
  * the speleological published works (articles, books, etc.) (almost 500)
  * the cadastrial data
  * the InGrigna activity reports since 2007
  * maps and other material

There are cross references between caves and publications, and in particular 
pablications containing maps of caves. The activity reports are georefernced and cross-referenced with caves.


== The app ==

The app interface is a Google map with overlaid a portion of the CTR map and the
cave positions. 

The cave marks carry a color/shape code. If the cave is "vertical" the mark is
a circle, if it is "horizontal" the mark is a semicircle. The color codes are 
  * grey: re-visited, no continuation
  * violet: not revisited yet
  * red: need digging
  * yellow: to revisit, need digging
  * green: to revisit with less snow,
  * dark green: to revisit
  * light blue: continue
  * blue: in exploration

Tapping on a cave mark opens the "cave dialog" with a summary of the data of the
cave and buttons to access the relevat documentation:
  * description
  * entrance photo
  * survey maps (either as image or pdf)
  * survey data (???)
  * cadastrial form
  * bibliography
  * survey bibliography

  * Search: query in the database
