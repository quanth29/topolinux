Howto compile TopoLinux


Get the latest tarball and untar it.
This creates the directory TopoLinux with the source files, and some
documentation. In particular you should have the following subdirectories:
  basic           TopoLinux utilities
  bin             where programs are placed
  calib           TopoLinux Calibration utilities
  distox          DistoX communication calsses
  experimental    experimental code [not used]
  docs            pdf docs
  help            help files (documentation)
  i18n            internationalization data files
  icons           icons
  memory          DistoX memory utilities
  pixmaps         pixmaps
  PTopo           PocketTopo classes ["empty"]
  QTcalib         QTopoCalib: calibration program
  QTshot          QTopoShot: measurements management program
  utils           utility classes
and some files.

Howto ccompile on Linux

[1]
First of all you must make in distox.

[2]
To copmpile the TopoLinux utilities make in basic, calib
and memory.

[3] 
To compile QTopoShot, first make in utils, then cd to QTshot and 
qmake and make.

[4]
To compile QTopoCalib, you need classes in utils and in QTshot.
Having already made QTshot, cd to QTcalib-02 and qmake and make.

[5] 
The programs qtshot and qtcalib are in the bin directory.
The utilities are left in basic, calib and memory.
To run qtshot and qtcalib you need the QTopo resource file.
A sample qtopo.rc is provided in the top directory.

For example cd to the top directory and type the command
    ./bin/qtshot

[6]
There is no installer.
You must install the programs by hand; for example
    cp ./bin/* /usr/local/bin
    mkdir /usr/local/etc/qtopo
    cp -r qtopo.rc i18n /usr/local/etc/qtopo

Howto compile on Windows (MSVC 2008)

[1] Prerequisite
You need the MS VC compiler: you can get MS VC Express edition
free from MicroSoft website.
You also need the QT libraries and development environment (header files,
and the MOC compiler).

[2] 
In a DOS window (cmd window) run the MOC compiler to
create the moc file from the headers
   QTshot.h
   PlotCanvas.h
   BackgroundImage.h
   QTcalib.h

[3]
Make VC project, including the files in QTshot, distox, utils.
Note that pixmaps must be added to the include directories.
