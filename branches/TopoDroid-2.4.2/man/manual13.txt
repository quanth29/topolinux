<h3>[13] CROSS SECTION</h3>

Cross-sections are kind of special. To tell TopoDroid that you want to draw a cross-section you must draw a "section" line, either in the plan view or in the extended elevation view. The section line defines the position of the cross-section and its orientation.<br><p>

A cross-section is the shape of the cave in a plane that cuts it. The orientation of the cross-section is the orientation of this plane, ie, the orientation of the line perpendicular to the plane, and pointing in the direction of sight. You define the orientation of the cross-section by the way you trace the section line. The direction of view of the section follows therion convention: from the right side of the section line to the left side. As a reminder the section line has a tick pointing in the direction of view of the cross-section.<br><p>

You can choose between a photo cross-section (taken with the camera), and a sketch cross-section. In the first case just take a photo that will remind you the shape of the gallery when you will be drafting the cave map. Make sure to have a fellow caver in the picture who will serve as size reference.<br><p>

In the second case you sketch the cross section on a canvas with the usual drawing tools of TopoDroid. As a reference TopoDroid displays the leg shot traversed by the cross section and the splay shots at its endpoints. The splay shots at the closer station are blue, those at the station far away are grey. All the shots are displayed projected on the plane of the cross section.  Furthermore a reference line 5 m long, oriented to the North, is added if the cross-section is "horizontal".<br><p>

A cross-section is "horizontal" if its inclination exceeds the value of the H-threshold, which is one of the settings.<br><p>

Once closed cross-section can be opened again and modified by selecting the relative section line in "edit" mode and tapping the <u>Edit</u> button.<br><p>

<h4>Cross-sections orientation</h4>
Cross-section defined in the plan sketch are always vertical. Those defined in the extended profile sketch can be at any angle although mots of the times you will draw them either vertical or horizontal.<br><p>

The section line is oriented as in Therion. Suppose that the section line crosses the leg 1-2. If its orientation agrees with that of the leg, the cross-section is considered as viewed from station 1 towards station 2. Otherwise it's the other way around: viewed from station 2 towards station 1.<br><p>

<b>Cross-sections in the plan view</b><br>
Cross-sections defined in the plan view are always vertical (zero inclination). Their orientation (ie, the azimuth of the cross-section plane) is determined by the section line; more precisely the azimuth of the cross-section is 90 degrees less than the direction the section line has been traced. For example if you draw the section line towards south (ie from top to bottom in the canvas) the cross-section has azimuth 90 degrees (ie, to the east).<br><p>

The crossed leg is displayed vertical when the cross-section has the same azimuth as the leg. Otherwise it is tilted right or left.<br><p>

<b>Cross-sections in the extended profile</b><br>
Cross-section in the extended profile have the azimuth of the crossed leg (or the opposite if the direction of the section line is the opposite than that of the leg) and inclination determined by the section line.

For eaxmple, if the leg 1-2 is crossed by the section line from the left side to the right side, then their directions agree, and the cross-section has the same azimuth as the leg. If it is crossed from the right to the left side, the directions are opposite and the azimuth of the cross-section differs from that of the leg by 180 degrees.<br><p>

If the section line traced from the left to the right, the cross-section is oriented upward and has positive inclination. Most of the times you will want to draw horizontal cross-sections as seen from above, as it is more natural to lay a map on a surface and look down at it.If you trace the section line from right to left the cross-section is oriented downward (inclination -90 degrees).<br><p>
 
The crossed leg is always displayed vertical as the cross-section has the same azimuth as the leg. Consequently, the north line, in "horizontal" cross-sections, is displayed at an angle with the vertical.<br><p>
