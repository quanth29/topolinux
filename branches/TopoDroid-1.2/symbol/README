TopoDroid symbols

To install a point that is not already included in TopoDroid copy the point file to the directory
TopoDroid/symbol/point on your Android.

You can put together two points that have no orientation. To do this, paste the two point files
together (eg, "cat ice snow > ice+snow") and copy the file with both points in the 
directory on Android.

You can edit the symbols as you please, as well as write new symbols.
Notes:
  the directive "symbol" is closed by "endsymbol".
  "name" and "th_name" must be single words: only the first word after the directive is used.
  "th_name" must be a valid therion name. TopoDroid does not check this, but Therion will complain.
  "color" is an hex number of the form 0xRRGGBB (alpha is set to 0xff by TopoDroid).
  "orientation" can have values "yes" or "no", depending whether the point has an orientation or not.
  "path" is a list of drawing directives (one per line). Supported commands are moveTo, lineTo, cubicTo,
       and addCircle (see the files for examples).
       The directive "path" is closed by "endpath".
